### Subjective Class Compared to Income Class

Cassandra Overney

Back in my hometown, many people consider themselves middle class regardless of their incomes. I grew up confusing income class with subjective class. After learning about their differences, I was curious to see whether a discrepancy between subjective and income class exists throughout America. The main question I wanted to answer was: **How does subjective class compare to income class?**

I found that income is not the only factor that Americans associate with class and that most respondents consider themselves to be either working or middle class. However, there are some discernable differences in subjective class based on income. For example, respondents in the lowest income class are more likely to consider themselves working class than middle class (10.7% vs 6.3%) while respondents in the highest income class are more likely to consider themselves middle class than working class (13.3% vs 4.2%).
