# Subjective Class Compared to Income Class

### Cassandra Overney

Back in my hometown, many people consider themselves middle class regardless of their incomes. I grew up confusing income class with subjective class. After learning about their differences, I was curious to see whether a discrepancy between subjective and income class exists throughout America. The main question I wanted to answer was

#### How does subjective class compare to income class?

I approached this question with several different methods including single variable analysis, side-by-side histograms, pairwise comparisons, and analysis replication.

I found that income is not the only factor that Americans associate with class, which connects to the idea of "status inconsistencies" in which Americans have flexible, and even multiple, class identities depending their settings. Most respondents consider themselves to be either working or middle class. Furthermore, the distribution of working and middle subjective class varies based on income. For example, respondents in the lowest income class are more likely to consider themselves working class while respondents in the highest income class are more likely to consider themselves middle class.
