## Goodbye Machine Learning, Hello Logistic Regression

#### Cassandra Overney and Khang Vu

Recently, there has been an increase in using complicated machine learning techniques to address data science questions. Machine learning is a powerful tool in that we do not need to have a thorough understanding of the data. Instead, deeper neural networks can find increasingly complex patterns in a dataset, a process known as representation learning. Sometimes, these models have high prediction accuracies. However, in other cases, especially for clinical prediction models, simpler techniques like linear and logistic regression work just as well, if not better.

Using data from the [Machine Learning with a Heart](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/54/machine-learning-with-a-heart/page/109/) DrivenData competition, we found that logistic regression results in higher accuracy for predicting the presence of heart disease compared to more complicated machine learning techniques (median accuracy: 83% compared to 76%).
